      "enhanced_message": "### SOURCE\n[1] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 17) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers6KEY MESSAGE Extra protein is required during illness, convalescence and after surgery because the body has extra demands for protein to replace and repair worn out tissues.Protein requirements The recommended intake of protein each day is about 1 gram per kilo - gram of body weight. Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: - Children: 30 -50 g (half a palm of meat) - Teenagers: 60 -75 g (a palm of meat) - Adults: 60 -70 g (a palm of meat) - Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature. These include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and are found in vegetable oils such as sunflower, corn, soybean, canola and olive oils. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats lowers risk of heart disease.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 5) 5 2) Micronutrients ............................................................................................... 8 Vitamins ..................................................................................................................... 8 Vitamins requirements .............................................................................................. 9 Minerals .................................................................................................................. 12 Water ...................................................................................................................... 15 Water requirements ............................................................................................... 15 NUTRITION .............................................................................................................. 15 What is nutrition? ................................................................................................... 16 CHAPTER TWO: MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION .................................. 17 What is malnutrition? ............................................................................................. 17 Types of malnutrition .............................................................................................. 17 a) Undernutrition ............................................................................................ 17 b) Micronutrient malnutrition (lack of minerals and vitamins) ...................... 19 c) Overnutrition ............................................................................................... 19 Prevalence of malnutrition in Uganda .................................................................... 20 Causes of malnutrition? .......................................................................................... 21 Consequences (cost) of malnutrition .....................................................................\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 25) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers14Magnesium Legumes, nuts, whole grains, avocado, DGLVAssists nerve and muscle function and release of energy from fats, proteins and carbohydrates.Spasms, cramps, tremors, constipation (strained bowel movements) Iodine Breast milk from mothers with good iodine status, iodized salt, sea fish, milk from animals with good iodine status, sea weeds, plants from soils rich in iodineit makes the brain and body function properly it is essential to the healthy development of unborn babies and young children.

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits. A serving is a quantity of food suitable for or given to one person in one meal. Moderation means keeping servings reasonable. This involves self- control and addresses the aspect of too much food intake that leads to becoming overweight and obese.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 7) 86 Annex 5.

Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 18) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers7Fat/lipid/oil requirements Fat provides high amounts of energy to the body; 1 g of fat produces over 9 kcals. Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces.

They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: - Carbohydrates - Proteins - Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 -3000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.\n\n### QUESTION\nIf I'm diabetic, does that mean I should eliminate all carbohydrates from my diet completely?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

This includes a number of routine activities that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards. Food safety is a public health priority because millions of people world - wide fall ill every year and many die as a result of eating unsafe food. Importance of food safety in Uganda - As the country develops, an increasing percentage of the population is eating food prepared from outside the home or at least processed away from home. The majority of the market participants in the food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas- ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption. - Current practices of food production, postharvest handling, process- ing, packaging, transportation, retailing and food preparation in the homes, street food vending and some restaurants may lead to food becoming unsafe for consumption. - Food safety related illnesses and problems such as cancer preva-lence are now a common occurrence in Uganda. - Much of this burden of illness results from basic sanitation failures that occur in food production, processing, storage, transportation, retailing and handling in the home or streets, restaurants and ho - tels. Potential hazards associated with food in Uganda Microbial pathogens for example: salmonella, campylobacter and esch- erichia coliare are associated with Diarrhoea diseases. Zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans through food products, for example tuberculosis and brucellosis. Parasitic or ganisms , in particular cysticercosis, tape worms other intes- tinal worms from poorly cooked pork or beef. Naturally occurring toxicants for example, mycotoxins like aflatoxin.Agrochemical and veterinary drug residues that are used in crop agricul- tural production including pesticides or animal production for example, antibiotics like tetracycline.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 72) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers61D) FOOD SAFETY IN AGRICULTURE Issues of food safety are gaining prominence each and every day world - wide because of urbanization, changing food habits, preferences, life- styles and food preparation methods. Street foods, food vending, restau-rants and hotels have become quite common of recent. Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: - Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites - Biological toxins such as mycotoxins - Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones - Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following: - Discoloration - Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes - Production of off odour Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso - ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans. There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition. It is also linked to negative outcomes in animal growth and reproduction. Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings. Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul - terated or badly stored foods. Generally, food safety describes the handling, preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent food\n\n### QUESTION\nAren't all processed foods filled with harmful chemicals?

Daily intake of fats/oils should not exceed 30% of total kilocalories. Intake of saturated fats should be 10% or less of the total fat intake per day. Cholesterol intake should not exceed 300 mg. Sources of fats/lipids/oils - Animal sources include meat, suet, bacon, oil fish, cheese, butter, lard, milk, and egg yolk. - Plant sources include groundnuts, soya, cocoa, sim-sim, maize, avo-cado, margarine, wheat germ, corn, sunflower, and palm oil. KEY MESSAGES - Excessive consumption of fat increases risk of heart disease. Use of oils from plant sources and fish reduces risk of heart disease. - Fat should be consumed in small quantities by adolescents and adults. Saturated fat increases the risk of heart disease. Re - placing saturated fat with unsaturated fat lowers risk of heart disease. Dietary fibre This is a form of complex carbohydrate that is part of the nondigestible portion of the food. Dietary fibre increases the body\u2019s sense of satisfaction thus preventing overeating. Diets high in fibre protect against constipation. Fibre can slow the body\u2019s absorption of sugar and cholesterol protecting the body from diseases of the heart and diabetes. Dietary fibre adds bulk to the faeces. In addition, dietary fibre slows down the breakdown of starch. Main sources of dietary fibre - Whole grains of cereals, for example: oats, millet, and maize bran. - Vegetables, for example: dodo, nakati, malakwang, cabbage, and pumpkin leaves.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 42) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers31cereals in porridge form if you can\u2019t manage them in the bread form every day. Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

Minerals of public health importance Iron is an essential component of blood and helps transfer oxygen to various body tissues. Dietary sources include red meat, fish, poultry (easily absorbed), legumes, leafy green vegetables (less easily absorbed, but absorption increases if eaten with animal source iron or vitamin C). Calcium is a key component of bones and teeth and is needed for a strong skeleton and important in blood clotting. The major source of calcium in the world is milk and milk products. Other sources include fish eaten with bones (silver fish\u2014mukene, haplochromis species\u2014nkeje) and dark green vegetables (plant sources are not well absorbed). Iodine is important for thyroid function and for mental development of children. The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains. Other minerals involved in various body functions are chromium, copper, fluoride, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, potas- sium, phosphorus, sodium and selenium. Mineral requirements Minerals that are required by the body in relatively large amounts such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, sodium and magnesium require deliberate efforts to be supplied them through increased food production, consumption and supplementation. Most trace mineral elements such as iodine copper, manganese, fluo - rine, cobalt, nickel, zinc, chromium and selenium are supplied by a wide variety of foods and the body is unlikely to be deficient in them when one consumes a balanced diet.\n\n### QUESTION\nIs iron poorly absorbed from food?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits. A serving is a quantity of food suitable for or given to one person in one meal. Moderation means keeping servings reasonable. This involves self- control and addresses the aspect of too much food intake that leads to becoming overweight and obese.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 43) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers32 Picture 6: Examples of a variety of the locally available foods from the three main food groupsAn example of a mixed meal guide to achieve a balanced diet SUMMARY - Eat a lot of whole cereals and beans or legumes generally, if you can\u2019t afford animal protein and as much as possible take some milk in your meals. - Eat a variety of food types from different main three groups (energy giving, body building and protective foods) at a very meal. - For lunch and supper take a fruit and a serving of vegetables (100g or one handful of fresh vegetables). - Avoid eating too much salt, too much sugar, drinking too much alcohol and too much fatty red meat. - These feeding habits predispose people to diseases such as: high blood pressure, diabetes, overweight, obesity.\n\n### QUESTION\nCan you make a meal plan for someone with diabetes and bad kidneys?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits. A serving is a quantity of food suitable for or given to one person in one meal. Moderation means keeping servings reasonable. This involves self- control and addresses the aspect of too much food intake that leads to becoming overweight and obese.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 45) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers34guidelines for selecting energy-giving foods, body-building foods and protective foods. Pregnant women especially need foods rich in iron and vitamin A in addition to the balanced diet. Iron needs are highly increased partly due to the need to build reserves for child up to six months after birth before initiating complementary food intake. - Pregnant women need to take foods rich in calcium, e.g., milk and mukene (silver fish) partly to take care of the increased requirement for building the foetus skeletal structure. - Pregnant women have higher needs for nutrients generally and should take snacks in between meals. In addition, pregnant women should be educated to strictly observe the following: 1. Take the required amounts of iron and folic acid supplements to prevent anaemia. 2. Sleep under an insecticide-treated mosquito net. 3. Visit the nearest health facility at least four (4) times for antenatal care. This will enable them access a number of services that prepare them to deliver a healthy baby. 4. Deliver in a healthy facility with the help of a skilled health worker. 5. Get deworming pills, IPT and tetanus vaccine from a health facility.6. Avoid excessive workloads therefore community and family support mechanisms should be encouraged. 7. Pregnant women should limit intake of alcohol, cigarettes. These cause negative effects on the foetus.\n\n### QUESTION\nMake a paleo meal plan for a 70-year-old woman with osteoporosis, high BP, and prediabetes.\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Vitamins Vitamins are organic compounds that perform specific metabolic func - tions in the body. There are two forms of vitamins: a) Fat-soluble vitamins These are stored by the body and require dietary fat to be absorbed. They include vitamins A, D, E and K. Fat-soluble vitamins are necessary for development and maintenance of body tissues and their functions, for example: eyes (vitamin A), bones (vitamin D), muscles and blood clot - ting (vitamin K), protection of cells (vitamin E), synthesis of enzymes and absorption of essential nutrients. Dietary sources of fat-soluble vitamins include carrots, tomatoes, liver, offal, kidney, gizzard, heart, milk and milk products and leafy vegetables. b) Water-soluble vitamins These are not stored by the body and must be consumed regularly. They include vitamins C (ascorbic acid) and the B complex group. Their functions include releasing energy, supporting utilization of macronu - trients and synthesizing red blood cells. Dietary sources of water-sol - uble vitamins include fruits, dark leafy vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish, poultry and fortified cereals. Citrus fruits are an espe- cially good source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is crucial for improving iron bioavailability from plant food sources.\n\n### QUESTION\nCan you do fasting for someone with kidney disease and anemia? Make a plan.\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it. Protective foods \u201cGLOW\u201d (vitamins and minerals) Select dark green leafy vegetables (DGLV), e.g., dodo, malakwang, (at least one serving per day) and yellow fruits (ripe bananas [2 small ripe apple/sweet bananas or 1 bogoya per day], one orange or one mango). Citrus fruits are very good but we don\u2019t have much in some parts of Uganda. The guavas can however substitute the citrus fruits well. Two guavas per day can be very healthy.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 43) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers32 Picture 6: Examples of a variety of the locally available foods from the three main food groupsAn example of a mixed meal guide to achieve a balanced diet SUMMARY - Eat a lot of whole cereals and beans or legumes generally, if you can\u2019t afford animal protein and as much as possible take some milk in your meals. - Eat a variety of food types from different main three groups (energy giving, body building and protective foods) at a very meal. - For lunch and supper take a fruit and a serving of vegetables (100g or one handful of fresh vegetables). - Avoid eating too much salt, too much sugar, drinking too much alcohol and too much fatty red meat. - These feeding habits predispose people to diseases such as: high blood pressure, diabetes, overweight, obesity.\n\n### QUESTION\nWhat should a vegan eat if they have gout, hypertension, and are allergic to soy and gluten?\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Ways of Boosting the Nutritive Value of Porridge How to further boost nutritive value or food value of porridge - Add vegetable oil to porridge improve its energy value. - Add eggs, milk to improve protein. - Use of flour made out of sprouted and dried cereal grains like millet. The presence of amylase partially digests the complex and bulky carbohydrates and makes the porridge more energy dense. - Add fruit juices like lemon, oranges, lime etc. just before serving porridge increases vitamin C value, palatability/ taste and enhances absorption of nutrients. Porridge made from fermented cereals or legumes reduce incidence of diarrhoea during weaning. Addition of juice from fruits (ascorbic acid) to porridge greatly enhances absorption of minerals like iron and improves the taste. Such food preparation methods should be encouraged in the communities. The advantages of sour and fermented porridge as a weaning food: - It is more difficult for harmful bacteria to grow in. It keeps safely for 2-3 days even in warm weather. It is therefore less likely to give a child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge. - It is thinner and easier for a baby to eat and digest than plain por - ridge. - The absorption of non-haem iron, zinc and some other minerals is increased. Suggestions for stopping the child from breast feeding Complete withdrawal of a child from breast milk should be a slow and gradual process. Encourage the mother to systematically stop breast feeding by following the steps below: - Make sure that the child continues to feed well at least four to five times a day.\n\n### QUESTION\nSuggest a 5-day juice cleanse for reversing diabetes and stage 3 CKD.\n\n### ANSWER\n",

Body building foods \u201cGROW\u201d (proteins) The best sources among these foods are animal foods i.e., milks, meats, fish, eggs, poultry. However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality. Milk is both a protective food and a body building food. Thus, as much as possible, it must be put in place for families to access it.

Pregnant women especially need foods rich in iron and vitamin A in addition to the balanced diet. Iron needs are highly increased partly due to the need to build reserves for child up to six months after birth before initiating complementary food intake. - Pregnant women need to take foods rich in calcium, e.g., milk and mukene (silver fish) partly to take care of the increased requirement for building the foetus skeletal structure. - Pregnant women have higher needs for nutrients generally and should take snacks in between meals. In addition, pregnant women should be educated to strictly observe the following: 1. Take the required amounts of iron and folic acid supplements to prevent anaemia. 2. Sleep under an insecticide-treated mosquito net. 3. Visit the nearest health facility at least four (4) times for antenatal care. This will enable them access a number of services that prepare them to deliver a healthy baby. 4. Deliver in a healthy facility with the help of a skilled health worker. 5. Get deworming pills, IPT and tetanus vaccine from a health facility.6. Avoid excessive workloads therefore community and family support mechanisms should be encouraged. 7. Pregnant women should limit intake of alcohol, cigarettes. These cause negative effects on the foetus.\n\n[2] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 46) Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition for breastfeeding mothers Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast - feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods. Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total). Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid stress and have enough rest.KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a pregnant mother has a balanced diet, with a vari- ety of foods from the food groups, and has one additional meal in addition to the 3 meals she receives daily. The fourth meal caters to her physiological needs. - Pregnant women should take iron and folate tablets daily in addition to foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin A. KEY MESSAGES - Ensure that a breastfeeding mother take a balanced diet and in addition to 3 meals daily receives 2 extra meals a day to main - tain her health and that of her baby. - A pregnant woman and breastfeeding mother should eat a variety of foods from the main food groups daily.\n\n[3] (Food & Nutrition Handbook, p. 44) One of the leading causes of maternal death at childbirth is insufficient blood.
